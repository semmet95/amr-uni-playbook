Certainly! Here's a simple example of two pods communicating with each other using Kubernetes. In this example, we'll create two pods: one serving as a "sender" pod and the other as a "receiver" pod. The sender pod will send a network request to the receiver pod.

Let's start with the YAML code for the sender pod:

```yaml
# sender-pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sender-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: sender-container
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do wget -O- receiver-pod; sleep 5; done"]
```

In this code:

- We define a simple Pod named "sender-pod" using the `busybox` image.
- The container in the pod uses the `wget` command to send an HTTP GET request to the "receiver-pod."

Next, let's create the YAML code for the receiver pod:

```yaml
# receiver-pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: receiver-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: receiver-container
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "nc -l -p 80"]
```

In this code:

- We define another Pod named "receiver-pod" using the same `busybox` image.
- The container in the pod uses the `nc` command (netcat) to listen on port 80, effectively setting up a simple TCP server.

After creating these YAML files, apply them to your Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl apply -f` command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f sender-pod.yaml
kubectl apply -f receiver-pod.yaml
```

Once both pods are up and running, the sender pod will continuously send HTTP requests to the receiver pod, and the receiver pod will listen on port 80 and respond.

Keep in mind that this is a basic example for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you might use services or more advanced communication mechanisms, like Kubernetes Services or DNS-based service discovery, to allow pods to communicate more effectively and reliably.
