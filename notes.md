- scale up the deployment and show that service endpoints get updated
- use the reader deployment to read the multi-dep pod's logs
- show how the pods can communicate freely but the IP has to be hardcoded and how services help with that, throw back to the label mentioned in #5
- give an exercise of turning the multi-dep pod to a deployment, expose using a service, scale up to 3, print timestamp in different timezones, then read from reader to see which pod it connects to
